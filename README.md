Welcome to the Machine Learning Tutorial for the TRISEP HEP Summer School at TRIUMF, June 16–27, 2025!
https://www.trisep.ca

This is a **hands-on tutorial** focused on practical applications of machine learning in high energy physics (HEP). You will actively code, experiment, and solve real-world HEP problems using modern data science tools. The sessions are designed for students and researchers eager to learn by doing—no prior machine learning experience required, though familiarity with Python and basic statistics is recommended.

Get ready to dive in, collaborate, and discover how machine learning can accelerate research in particle physics!


## Exercise 3: Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) for Higgs classification

## Exercise 4: Comparisons of MLP and BDT performance
Try to compare the ROC curves of the MLP and the BDT. Which one is performing better? Why?
